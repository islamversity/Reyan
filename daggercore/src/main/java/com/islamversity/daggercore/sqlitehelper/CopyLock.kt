/**
 * Utility class for in-process and multi-process key-based lock mechanism for safely copying
 * database files.
 *
 *
 * Acquiring the lock will be quick if no other thread or process has a lock with the same key.
 * But if the lock is already held then acquiring it will block, until the other thread or process
 * releases the lock. Note that the key and lock directory must be the same to achieve
 * synchronization.
 *
 *
 * Locking is done via two levels:
 *
 *  1.
 * Thread locking within the same JVM process is done via a map of String key to ReentrantLock
 * objects.
 *  1.
 * Multi-process locking is done via a lock file whose name contains the key and FileLock
 * objects.
